      <div class="text-1">
      If you suspect you might have thalassophobia, there are a few things that you can do. An informal online test might give you an indication that you have this type of specific phobia. Such internet-based, at-home tests might involve looking at potentially triggering images or taking a quiz to determine the extent and severity of your symptoms. <br><br>

      While there is no formal test or assessment to diagnose this phobia, your doctor will likely assess your symptoms and investigate any possible underlying medical factors. Once your doctor understands your medical and symptom history, you may then be formally diagnosed with a specific phobia. 
      </div>

      <div class="text-1a">
      In order to be diagnosed with a specific phobia according to the DSM-5; Your fear of deep water is persistent, excessive, and unreasonable. You feel this fear every time you are exposed to deep or open water, you realize that your fear is out of proportion to the actual dangers, you either avoid the ocean or other waters or endure them with intense fear, your fear of large bodies of water interferes with your normal functioning, you fear has been present for six months or longer or your fear is not better explained by another disorder such as generalized anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder.

      <div class="subheading-1">Treatment</div>
      <div class="text-1">
      While there is no research available on the treatment of thalassophobia specifically, it is assumed that people would experience similar treatment results to those of other phobias.
      <br><br>

      Research suggests that behavior therapy treatments, particularly exposure-based treatments, tend to be quite effective at reducing symptoms of specific phobias. <br><br>

      Research has found that not all treatments have the same effectiveness for different subtypes of specific phobias.2﻿ In vivo exposure (which involves being exposed to the fear object in real life), for example, while effective for all types, also has high dropout rates and poor treatment acceptance.
      </div>

      <div class="text-1a">
      Research suggests that in vivo exposure tends to be more effective than imagined exposure, but a study published in Frontiers in Psychology found that virtual exposure appeared as effective as real-world exposure.
       <br><br>

      Of course, exposure to a fear object in real-life is not always possible, particularly if it involves something dangerous or impossible. In the case of thalassophobia, live exposure to open water may be the most effective but imagined exposure may provide some benefits if this is not possible.
