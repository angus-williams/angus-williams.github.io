      <div class="text-1">
      Thalassophobia is a type of specific phobia that involves a persistent and intense fear of deep bodies of water such as the ocean or sea. What makes this phobia different than aquaphobia, the fear of water? <br><br>

      Where aquaphobia involves a fear of water itself, thalassophobia centers on bodies of water that seem vast, dark, deep, and dangerous. People are not afraid of the water so much as they are afraid of what lurks beneath its surface. <br><br>

      While thalassophobia is not recognized as a distinct disorder by the DSM-5, the diagnostic manual of mental disorders used by psychiatrists and other mental health professionals, its symptoms may fall under the diagnostic criteria for specific phobias.1

      <div class="text-1a">
      According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), phobias are the most common type of mental illness in the United States. While specific phobias themselves are quite common among the general population, it is unknown how many people have thalassophobia.<br><br> 

      Specific phobias tend to be one of five different types; Animal type, Blood-injection type, Natural-environment type, Situational type or Other.
      <br><br>

      Thalassophobia is usually considered a natural-environment type of specific phobia. Natural environment fears tend to be one of the more frequently experienced types of phobias, with some studies suggesting that water-related phobias tend to be more common among women.
