      an abnormal fear of the sea. <br><br>

      <div class="subheading-1">Causes & Factors</div>
      <div class="text-1">
      There are a number of factors that may cause this fear of the ocean and sea. Like other types of phobia, it is likely a combination of nature and nurture that contributes to thalassophobia. <br><br>

      Genetics; From a nature perspective, evolution and genetics may play a role. Our ancestors who were more cautious and fearful of deep bodies of water were probably more likely to survive and pass down these fearful genes to their offspring. <br><br>

      Past Experiences; This fear may also be partially learned due to experiences people may have had around water. Being frightened by something while swimming, for example, may also be a possible cause of this type of fear. 
      <br><br></div>

      <div class="text-1a">
      Upbringing; Observing other people, particularly parental figures and other influential adults, who also had a fear of deep water might also be a contributing factor. <br><br>

      There are also a number of risk factors that might increase the likelihood that a person will develop a specific phobia such as thalassophobia. Some of these include: Having a family member with thalassophobia or another type of specific phobia. Personality factors, such as being more negative, sensitive, or anxious. Traumatic personal experiences involving deep water, large bodies of water, or ocean travel. Hearing stories from other people or through media sources focused on water accidents.

      <div class="subheading-1">Signs & Symptoms</div>
      <div class="text-1">
       A phobia can trigger both physical and emotional symptoms of anxiety and fear.  <br><br>

      Some of the common physical symptoms of thalassophobia include; dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, racing heart, rapid breathing, shortness of breath and sweating. Emotional symptoms can include; being overwhelmed, feelings of anxiety, feeling detached from the situation, having a sense of imminent doom and needing to escape <br><br>

      This fear response can happen if you come into direct contact with the ocean or other deep bodies of water, such as driving past the beach or flying over the ocean on a plane. But you don't necessarily have to be near water to experience symptoms.
    </div>

      <div class="text-1a">
      A phobic response is more than just feeling nervous or anxious. Imagine how you felt the last time you were faced with something dangerous. You probably experienced an immediate and intense onset of the fight-or-flight response, a series of reactions that prepare your body to either stay and deal with the threat or run away from the danger. A person with thalassophobia will experience that same reaction even if the response is out of proportion to the actual danger. <br><br>

      In addition to these physical symptoms when encountering deep water, people will also go to great lengths to avoid being near or having to even look at large bodies of water. They may experience anticipatory anxiety when they know that they will be encountering the object of their fear, such as feeling extremely nervous before boarding a ferry boat and forms of water travel.
